    ABOUT_APP: `
    The NOC Connect web application connects the National Olympic Committee of Sri Lanka with athletes, sponsors, and officials. 
    Its mission is to streamline event management, deliver important updates, and create sponsorship opportunities for emerging talents.

    Players:
    Players can sign up using the Sign Up page. Once registered, their accounts must be approved by an NOC Official before they can access and manage their profiles. After approval, players can upload certificates, list their achievements, and receive notifications when sponsors show interest.

    Sponsors:
    Sponsors can register through the Sign Up page. Their accounts must also be approved by an NOC Official before they can explore player profiles. Once approved, sponsors can browse talent, review achievements, and directly contact players to offer sponsorship support.

    NOC Officials:
    NOC Officials (Admins) manage platform activities. Admin accounts are not created via the public Sign Up page. After login, admins can approve player and sponsor registrations, publish volunteer requests, and receive system notifications about leadership changes and organizational updates.
